\usage{
draw_contour_OCN(OCN, thrADraw = 0.002 * OCN$FD$nNodes *
  OCN$cellsize^2, exactDraw = TRUE, drawContours = TRUE, colPalRiver = NULL, 
  colPalCont = "#000000", drawOutlets = 0, pch = 15, colPalOut = "#000000",
  min_lwd = 0.5, max_lwd = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{OCN}{A \code{river} object as produced by \code{\link{landscape_OCN}}.}

\item{thrADraw}{Threshold drainage area value used to display the network.}

\item{exactDraw}{If \code{TRUE}, the real shape of OCNs is plotted. If flow crosses a boundary, 
the pixel that is not contiguous to its outlet is flipped. It is only effective if \code{OCN$PeriodicBoundaries = TRUE}}

\item{drawContours}{If \code{TRUE}, plot catchment(s) contours.}

\item{colPalRiver}{Color palette used to plot the river network(s). Default is a rearranged version of theme \code{"Dark 3"} (see \code{\link{hcl.pals}}). \code{colPalRiver} accepts both functions creating color palettes and vectors of colors (of which the first \code{OCN$nOutlet} elements are used). If a single color value is provided and \code{OCN$nOutlet > 1}, all river networks are drawn with the same color.}

\item{colPalCont}{Color palette used to plot the catchment contour(s). Details as in \code{colPalRiver}. Additionally, if \code{colPalCont = 0}, the palette specified in \code{colPalRiver} is copied. }

\item{drawOutlets}{If equal to \code{1}, black squares are drawn at the outlets' locations behind the river; if \code{2} they are plotted on top of the river.}

\item{pch}{Shape of the outlet points (if \code{drawOutlets = TRUE}). See \code{\link{points}} for legend.}

\item{colPalOut}{Color palette used to plot the outlet points (if \code{drawOutlets = TRUE}). Details as in \code{colPalRiver}. Additionally, if \code{colPalOut = 0}, the palette specified in \code{colPalRiver} is copied. }

\item{min_lwd, max_lwd}{Minimum and maximum values of line width used to display the OCN (actual line width is proportional to the square root of drainage area).}

\description{
Function that plots real-shaped OCN and catchment contours.
}
\details{
For not too large networks (i.e. if \code{OCN$FD$nNodes <= 40000}, corresponding to a 200x200 lattice), 
pixels whose drainage area \code{OCN$FD$A} is lower than \code{thrADraw} are drawn with a light grey stroke.
If \code{OCN$FD$nNodes > 40000}, in order to speed up the execution of this function, only the network constituted 
by pixels such that \code{OCN$FD$A > thrADraw} is drawn.
}
\examples{
# 1) draw contour of a 20x20 single-outlet OCN
# (for single-outlet OCNs without periodic boundaries, the output
# of draw_contour_OCN is very similar to that of draw_simple_OCN)
draw_contour_OCN(landscape_OCN(OCN_20), thrADraw = 4)

\dontrun{
# 2a) plot real shape of multiple-outlet OCN created with periodic boundaries
# add outlets on top of the rivers
OCN <- landscape_OCN(OCN_300_4out_PB_hot, displayUpdates = 2) # it takes around one minute
draw_contour_OCN(OCN, drawOutlets = 2)

# 2b) same as before, but use same color palette for rivers and contours
draw_contour_OCN(OCN, colPalCont = 0)

# 2c) draw contours of catchments obtained from an OCN with nOutlet = "All"
OCN <- landscape_OCN(OCN_400_Allout, displayUpdates = 2) # it takes some minutes
draw_contour_OCN(OCN)

# 2d) same as above, but do not plot contours, and plot outlets 
# with same color palette as rivers
draw_contour_OCN(OCN, drawContours = FALSE, drawOutlets = TRUE,
		colPalOut = 0)
