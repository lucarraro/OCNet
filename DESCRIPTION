Description: Generate and analyze Optimal Channel Networks (OCNs): 
	oriented spanning trees reproducing all scaling features characteristic 
	of real, natural river networks. As such, they can be used in a variety 
	of numerical experiments in the fields of hydrology, ecology and 
	epidemiology. See Carraro et al. (2020) <doi:10.1002/ece3.6479> 
	for a presentation of the package; Rinaldo et al. (2014) 
	<doi:10.1073/pnas.1322700111> for a theoretical overview on the OCN 
	concept; Furrer and Sain (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i10> for the 
	construct used.
